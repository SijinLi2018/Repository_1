### 1. Axioms
1. Def Axioms 
    1. Statements that form the starting point of a mathematical discussion) call the axioms.
   
    2. Axioms are assumed (by an agreement between author and reader) without question or deeper analysis.
    3. Mathematical theory is rich if a great deal can be deduced from a few primitive (and intuitively acceptable) axioms.
    4. The axioms in one course may in fact be theorems in a deeper course whose axioms are more primitive.
2. Doc Axioms (binary operations)   
\* m, n, and p are integers   
    1. [m + n = n + m] (commutativity of addition)
        
    2. [(m + n) + p = m + (n + p)] (associativity of addition)
    3. [m*(n+ p) = m * n + m * p] (distributivity)
    4. [m * n = n * m] (commutativity of multiplication)
    5. [(m * n) * p = m * (n * p)] (associativity of multiplication)
    6. There exists an integer 0 such that whenever [m 'BL' Z (a integers 'set')], [m + 0 = m]. (identity element for addition)
    7. There exists an integer 1 such that [1 != 0] and whenever [m 'BL' Z], [m * 1 = m]. (identity element for multiplication)
    8. For each [m 'BL' Z], there exists an integer, denoted by -m, such that [m+ (-m)] = 0. (additive inverse)
    9. Let m, n, and p be integers. If [m * n = m * p] and [m != 0], then [n = p]. (cancellation))
### 2. Symbols
1. 'BL' means 'a elementry of'; e.g. [0 'BL' Z] means '0' is an elementry of set 'Z'. 
2. '=' means equal; def two or mutiple sets or elements are identical to each other; e.g. [m = n]  
    1. [m = m] (reflexivity)
   
    2. If [m = n] then [n = m]. (symmetry)
    3. If [m = n] and [n = p] then [m = p]. (transitivity)
    4. If [m = n], then 'n' can be substituted for 'm' in any statement without changing the meaning of that statement. (replacement)
3. '!=' means not equal; def two sets or elements are not identical to each other. 
    1. 'symmetry' is acceptable
   
    2. 'reflexivity' is illegal
    3. 'transitivity' is illegal
    4. 'replacement' is illegal, quo indefinable/invalid.
 
4. '!BL' means 'is not an element of'/'elements are not in the set', restriction are identical to section '#2.3'.
