# VII. Programming Recommendations
## 22. Programming Recommendations
### 22.1 Rule
```
1. Code should be written in a way that does not disadvantage other implementations of Python.

2. Comparisons to singletons like None should always be done with 'is' or 'is_not'

3. Equality operators are [illegal]. 

4. Use 'is_not' operator rather than 'not ... is'

5. A def statement is Necessary.

6. Derive exceptions from Exception rather than BaseException.

7. Exception chaining is Recommended.

8. 'raise_ValueError('message')' is Recommended. (*Python_2 & Python_3 ) 

9. Mention specific exceptions whenever possible instead of using a bare ‘except:’, when catching exceptions.

10. Limit use of bare 'except' (*Thumb)

11. When binding caught exceptions to a name, prefer the explicit name binding syntax added in Python 2.6

12. When catching operating system errors, prefer the explicit exception hierarchy introduced in Python 3.3 over introspection of errno values.

13. For all try/except clauses, limit the try clause to the absolute minimum amount of code necessary.

14. When a resource is local to a particular section of code, use a with statement to ensure it is cleaned up promptly and reliably after use. 
    
    * A try/finally statement is also acceptable.


15. Context managers should be invoked through separate functions or methods whenever they do something other than acquire and release resources.

16. Either all return statements in a function should return an expression, or none of them should. 

17. Use string methods instead of the string module.

18. Use ''.startswith() and ''.endswith() instead of string slicing to check for prefixes or suffixes.

19. Object type comparisons should always use isinstance() instead of comparing types directly.

20. Use the fact that empty sequences are false. (*Sequences)

21. String literals are Prohibited.

22. Comparing boolean values to True or False using is prohibited.

## 23. Function Annotations
### 23.1 Rule
```
1. 'PEP 484' syntax is Recommanded. (*Python_3)

2. Experimentation with annotation styles is Inadvisable. (*PEP_484_syntax)

3. Experimentation with annotation styles is Inadvisable. (*PEP_484_syntax)

4. Experiments within the rules of PEP 484 are Recommended.

5. For code that wants to make a different use of function annotations it is recommended to put a comment of the form:
    
    # type: ignore
    

6. Type checkers are optional.

7. For 'Backwards compatible' checks 'PEP_484' 
```
## 24. Variable Annotations
### 24.1 Rule
```
1. Check 'PEP_526' for variable annotations. 

    *PEP_484 also recommended. 

2. Annotations for module level variables, class and instance variables, and local variables should have a single space after the colon.

3. There should be no space before the colon.

4. If an assignment has a right hand side, then the equality sign should have exactly one space on both sides. 
```
### 24.2 Condition
```

    code: int

    class Point:
        coords: Tuple[int, int]
        label: str = '<unknown>'

    
    [c.Ius]
    
    code:int  # No space after colon
    code : int  # Space before colon

    class Test:
        result: int=0  # No spaces around equality sign
```
