### Part I: Abstraction 

#### Section 1: Background

The comic "watchman", wrote by Alan Moore who created "V for Vendetta" and "Batman: the killing joke" in 1986, reconstructed and broken the orthodox image of superheroes as protectors of citizens and highest ethic symbol of society. Similar to "V for Vendetta" and "Batman: the Killing Joke", "watchman" caricatured the corrupts of politic and the ignorance of social issues under a rational World-Order to insinuate faultinesses of the past history and amplify the weakness of humanity. The background was set in 1980s when the cold war was nearly ended not with the dissolution of USSR but the Final Judgment of humanity by millions of nuclear warheads. The doomsday began when the fragile Balance vacillated on a mound of nuclear weapons was collapsed and ignited due to the existence of superheroes who ought to be the keeper of peace. Through this pessimistic background, Alan Moore bought a question to his reader: were superheroes the salvation or the key to Pandora's box.    

#### Section 2: Superheroes

Comparing with "Captain America" and "Batman", Alan Moore provided a more deeper understanding for his superheroes in "Watchmen". Not like traditional heroes' regular appearance in fiction, superheroes of "watchmen" were created with a more realistic human emotion--the fiction was not bought to the world but world merged in to the fiction. Despite superheroes in the comic had extraordinary power, they were emotionally human like and easy to be corrupted. Every member of "watchmen" had their own standard and explanation of justice, for example The Comedian who murdered innocence civilians in Vietnam war and violently against the procession considered his action was another path to apply the Justice. Although, they were men with great powers but inside of them existed a ordinary heart. Superheroes was only a mask to conceal their past and mystified present.

#### Section 3: Doctor Manhattan

There existed special character in the the comic who had great power could crash heavy tanks in a second and evaporate human in to particles. Different from other heroes, Dr. Manhattan seemed like follow the path of traditional who was mutated during an accident or experiment and unintentionally gained superpower, e.g. Hulk, spider-man, death pool etc. The human origin of Dr. Manhattan was Dr. Jonathan Osterman, a talented nuclear physicist, who was premeditatedly locked in the experiment room just few second before the experiment began. Then his body was shot in to quantum level particles by plasma gun instantaneously. However, after few days, people found him alive in a unfathomable form. US government and Pentagon immediately detected his martial value through experiments and absorb him into US Army as soon as he step out from the laboratory. Once again, his dread power was proofed by the scream of his enemy on the battle of Vietnam and himself became a gigantic threaten to the other side (communism). As time passed, the personality of Dr. Manhattan changed as well. While The Comedian murder a innocence woman, Dr. Manhattan had ability to stop the bullet but he ignored the fatal death of that woman and stood aside from this homicide. As the Comedian committed: he became more and more unrelenting.    

#### Section 4: Story line

Similar to the proposal in "Civil War",in 1977, Superheroes were suggested to either working for government or retiring from his or her superhero career. Some of superheroes like Comedian and Dr. Manhattan accepted the work in government, and some of them gradually left the headlines of newspapers. Story began with the mysterious death of Comedian. After his death, his friend, Rorschach who was also the member of "watchmen" tried to find out the killer. Several days later another member of "watchmen" was threaten to death. Rorschach soon found the relation between those two evens--Superheroes were the target. In the end of story, Rorschach, Nite Owl II, and Silk Spectre II discovered that the murderer was actually one of the "watchmen" member--Adrian Veidt or Ozymandias. The purpose was to balance the power between two side and to save human from the massacre of nuclear war. However, eventually, the nuclear war was ineluctably  happened as Dr. Manhattan predicted.
