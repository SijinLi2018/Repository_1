### Part I: Abstraction

#### Section 1: Story line

Similar to the proposal in "Civil War",in 1977, Superheroes were suggested to either working for government or retiring from his or her superhero career. Some of superheroes like Comedian and Dr. Manhattan accepted the work in government, and some of them gradually left the headlines of newspapers. Story began with the mysterious death of Comedian. After his death, his friend, Rorschach who was also the member of "watchmen" tried to find out the killer. Several days later another member of "watchmen" was threaten to death. Rorschach soon found the relation between those two evens--Superheroes were the target. In the end of story, Rorschach, Nite Owl II, and Silk Spectre II discovered that the murderer was actually one of the "watchmen" member--Adrian Veidt or Ozymandias. The purpose was to balance the power between two side and to save human from the massacre of nuclear war. However, eventually, the nuclear war was ineluctably happened as Dr. Manhattan predicted.



#### Section 2: Superheroes

Comparing with "Captain America" and "Batman", Alan Moore provided a more deeper understanding for his superheroes in "Watchmen". Not like traditional heroes' regular appearance in fiction, superheroes of "watchmen" were created with a more realistic human emotion--the fiction was not bought to the world but world merged in to the fiction. Despite superheroes in the comic had extraordinary power, they were emotionally human like and easy to be corrupted. Every member of "watchmen" had their own standard and explanation of justice, for example The Comedian who murdered innocence civilians in Vietnam war and violently against the procession considered his action was another path to apply the Justice. Although, they were men with great powers but inside of them existed a ordinary heart. Superheroes was only a mask to conceal their past and mystified present.

#### Section 3: Doctor Manhattan

There existed special character in the the comic who had great power could crash heavy tanks in a second and evaporate human in to particles. Different from other heroes, Dr. Manhattan seemed like follow the path of traditional who was mutated during an accident or experiment and unintentionally gained superpower, e.g. Hulk, spider-man, death pool etc. The human origin of Dr. Manhattan was Dr. Jonathan Osterman, a talented nuclear physicist, who was premeditatedly locked in the experiment room just few second before the experiment began. Then his body was shot in to quantum level particles by plasma gun instantaneously. However, after few days, people found him alive in a unfathomable form. US government and Pentagon immediately detected his martial value through experiments and absorb him into US Army as soon as he step out from the laboratory. Once again, his dread power was proofed by the scream of his enemy on the battle of Vietnam and himself became a gigantic threaten to the other side (communism). As time passed, the personality of Dr. Manhattan changed as well. While The Comedian murder a innocence woman, Dr. Manhattan had ability to stop the bullet but he ignored the fatal death of that woman and stood aside from this homicide. As the Comedian committed: he became more and more unrelenting.

#### Section 4: Background 

The comic "watchman", wrote by Alan Moore who created "V for Vendetta" and "Batman: the killing joke" in 1986, reconstructed and broken the orthodox image of superheroes as protectors of citizens and highest ethic symbol of society. Similar to "V for Vendetta" and "Batman: the Killing Joke", "watchman" caricatured the corrupts of politic and the ignorance of social issues under a rational World-Order to insinuate faultinesses of the past history and amplify the weakness of humanity. The background was set in 1980s when the cold war was nearly ended not with the dissolution of USSR but the Final Judgment of humanity by millions of nuclear warheads. The doomsday began when the fragile Balance vacillated on a mound of nuclear weapons was collapsed and ignited due to the existence of superheroes who ought to be the keeper of peace. Through this pessimistic background, Alan Moore bought a question to his reader: were superheroes the salvation or the key to Pandora's box.

### Part II: Analysis

#### Section 1: Characters
The special story line and the abnormal character with their ironic critique of politic and humanity achieved the success of "Watchmen" which brought a fresh feeling and ideology of superhero-characters and made it stand out from millions of same type comics; Even though there were only 12 issues, the complexity of the plots had overwhelm lots of his ancestor comic e.g. "Captain America", "Batman" "Superman" etc. Similar to other comic books, Characters was the backbone of a comic; A well developed Character could save a fragmentary story, on the other hand, a insufficient character development could devastate the vigorous line of plot. i.e. Character were important. Characters in "watchmen" was simply pathetic and miserable. Unlike their colleagues in other superhero-comic who was applauded by public and legally supported by government, Superheroes in "watchmen" were bounded by government decision and laws, and all of them excepted Doctor Manhattan did not have factual superpower. People who claimed themselves superheroes were actually normal humans. Thus, superheroes in "watchmen" were the inferior imitation of the Superhero concept. This event point out another concept that superheroes created by many authors and imaged by many readers, were not existing in real world; if there existed a superhero, then this superhero was only a reformation of human appearance. Therefore the superman was not decided by appearance but deeply in its heart of recognition.         

#### Section 2: Philosophy

Doctor Manhattan in the comic was certainly a special and controversial character, since he was only character who really had superpower and should considered as traditional heroes but did not fallen in to the path of controversial heroes. Indeed, ironically, in the start of the story, US government presumably consider he as a god stood on the side with US government, since they did not realized that this god would step away from human. By following the food print of Dr. Manhattan, readers could crystallized the growth of Dr. Manhattan--from human to god. While Alan Moore, the author, depicted how human became to god, hundred years ago, Friedrich Nietzsche presented a path to superman. The philosophy in "watchman" interestingly shared some similarity with the Superman(*Übermensch*) theory. As Nietzsche described man was a string hanged between superman and beast over abyss (*Der Mensch ist ein Seil, geknüpft zwischen Tier und Übermensch - ein Seil über einem Abgrunde.*)  in "thus spoke zarathustra" (*also sprach zarathustra*) . He defined the superman as a ideal formation of human but was not human, meanwhile. In comic Dr. Jonathan Osterman shotted to death and transformed in to Dr. Manhattan. The question was did the Dr. Manhattan, the superhero, as same as Dr. Jonathan Osterman, the human'. From the perspective of continuity, Dr. Manhattan and Dr. Jonathan Osterman was same person, but mentally different. After Dr. Jonathan Osterman realized his devastating power and invenceable body, he might reconstrut the concept of human and spreaded himself from human race. If we expanded the concept of Superman theory, there would appear threestages: from beast to human, from human to superman, from superman to god. (P.S. this god did not relate to Nihilism god which Nietzsche againsted) Different steps in this new theory was one direction reversable during progression i.e. human could become beast and superman could degenerate to man. From Dr. Jonathan Osterman to Dr. Manhattan, he had went through two phases of three. When first time he gained the power, he still could remember what he loved and what he hated, and after years and dacades, memory was waped out from his mind thus in the end he said that:"In my opinion, the existence of life is a highly overrated phenomenon."  And from the character itself, Dr.Manhattan was a existentialist who believe that the existance of human could not simply determined by human itself i.e. there was no reson for the existance of human. ( It was meaningless for self defining since it would form a loop of logic and reasult in nothing, thus, eventhough, every thing was definable, at the same time nothing was definable from itself.)   

### Part III: Conclusion  

The comic "watchmen" was too complex to completely analysis it or even a single character. Every character had a different background, emotion and judgment in a special environment. Even, every sentence had a deep philosophy understanding in behind. All elements in this comic was such controversial and thus was argued by many readers until today.
