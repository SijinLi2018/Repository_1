### Introduction
organize information about the integers, making clear what follows from what.\
### 1. Axioms
1. Def Axioms 
    1. Statements that form the starting point of a mathematical discussion) call the axioms.
   
    2. Axioms are assumed (by an agreement between author and reader) without question or deeper analysis.
    3. Mathematical theory is rich if a great deal can be deduced from a few primitive (and intuitively acceptable) axioms.
    4. The axioms in one course may in fact be theorems in a deeper course whose axioms are more primitive.
2. Doc Axioms (binary operations)   
\* m, n, and p are integers   
    1. [m + n = n + m] (commutativity of addition)
        
    2. [(m + n) + p = m + (n + p)] (associativity of addition)
    3. [m*(n+ p) = m * n + m * p] (distributivity)
    4. [m * n = n * m] (commutativity of multiplication)
    5. [(m * n) * p = m * (n * p)] (associativity of multiplication)
    6. There exists an integer 0 such that whenever [m 'BL' Z (a integers 'set')], [m + 0 = m]. (identity element for addition)
    7. There exists an integer 1 such that [1 != 0] and whenever [m 'BL' Z], [m * 1 = m]. (identity element for multiplication)
    8. For each [m 'BL' Z], there exists an integer, denoted by -m, such that [m+ (-m)] = 0. (additive inverse)
    9. Let m, n, and p be integers. If [m * n = m * p] and [m != 0], then [n = p]. (cancellation))
### 2. Symbols
1. 'BL' means 'a elementry of'; e.g. [0 'BL' Z] means '0' is an elementry of set 'Z'. 
2. '=' means equal; def two or mutiple sets or elements are identical to each other; e.g. [m = n]  
    1. [m = m] (reflexivity)
   
    2. If [m = n] then [n = m]. (symmetry)
    3. If [m = n] and [n = p] then [m = p]. (transitivity)
    4. If [m = n], then 'n' can be substituted for 'm' in any statement without changing the meaning of that statement. (replacement)
3. '!=' means not equal; def two sets or elements are not identical to each other. 
    1. 'symmetry' is acceptable
   
    2. 'reflexivity' is illegal
    3. 'transitivity' is illegal
    4. 'replacement' is illegal, quo indefinable/invalid.
 
4. '!BL' means 'is not an element of'/'elements are not in the set', restriction are identical to section '#2.3'.   
### 3. First Consequence
1. Consequence  
Any logical system processes by Axioms are definite legal, quo Axioms are definite legal; else are illegal. 

    1. If m, n, and p are integers, then (m + n) * p = m * p + n * p  
proof:
        1. Let [m, n, p 'BL' Z]
        2. [(m + n) * p = p * (m + n)] (Term 1.2.4)
        3. [p * (m + n) = p * m + p * n] (Term 1.2.3)
        4. [p * m + p * n = m * p + n * p] (Term 1.2.4)  
        \* [p * m = m * p] (Term 1.2.4) & [p * n = n * p] (Term 1.2.4)
        1. sic. [(m + n) * p = m * p + n * p] (Term 2.2.3)
    3. If m is an integer, then 0 + m = m and 1 * m = m
     
    4. If m is an integer, then (- m) + m = 0
    5. Let m, n, and p be integers. If m + n = m + p, then n = p
    6. Let [m,x1,x2 'BL' Z]. If [m,x1,x2] satisfy the equations [m + x1 = 0] and [m + x2 = 0], then [x1 = x2]
    7. If m, n, p, and q are integers, then
        1. (m + n) * (p + q) = (m * p + n * p) + (m * q + n * q)
   
        2. m + (n + (p + q)) = (m + n) + (p + q) = ((m + n) + p) + q
        3. m + (n + p) = (p + m) + n
        4. m * (n * p) = p * (m * n)
        5. m * (n + (p + q)) = (m * n + m * p) + m * q
        6. (m * (n + p)) * q = (m * n) * q+m * (p * q)
    8. Let [x 'BL' Z]. If x has the property ***that for each integer m***, m + x = m, then x = 0
    9. Let [x 'BL' Z]. If x has the property ***that there exists an integer m*** such that [m + x = m], then [x = 0]
    10. For all [m 'BL' Z], [m * 0 = 0 = 0 * m]
    11. If m and n are even integers, then so are m+n and mn
    12. 0 is divisible by every integer
    13. If m is an integer not equal to 0, then m is not divisible by 0
    14. Let [x 'BL' Z]. if x has the property that **for all [m 'BL' Z]**, [m * x = m] then [x = 1] 
    15. Let [x 'BL' Z]. If x has the property that for **some nonzero [m 'BL' Z]**, [m * x = m], then [x = 1].  
    proof:
        1. Assume [x 'BL' Z]
        2. [m * x = m = m * 1] (Term 1.2.7) 
        3. sic.[x = 1] (Term 1.2.9)
    16. For all [m,n 'BL' Z], [(-m) * (-n) = m * n]  
    proof:
        1. [m + (-m) = 0] & [n + (-n) = 0] (Term 1.2.8)
        2. [(m + (-m)) * n = 0] & [(-m) * (n + (-n)) = 0] (Term 3.1.10)
        3. [m * n + (-m) * n = 0] & [(-m) * n + (-m) * (-n) = 0] (Term 1.2.3 & Term 3.1.1)
        4. [m * n = (-m) * (-n)] (Term 1.2.1 & Term 3.1.5) 
    17. For all [m 'BL' Z], [-(-m) = m]
    18. [-0 = 0]
    19. Given [m,n 'BL' Z] there exists one and only one [x 'BL' Z] such that [m + x = n]  
    proof:
    20. Let [x 'BL' Z]. If [x * x = x] then [x = 0 or 1]
    21. For all [m,n 'BL' Z]:
        1. -(m + n) = (-m) + (-n)
        2. -m = (-1) * m
        3. (-m) * n = m * (-n) = -(m * n)
    22. Let [m,n 'BL' Z]. If [m * n = 0], then [m = 0 or n = 0]  
    proof:
2. Divisible
    1. When m and n are integers, we say m is **divisible** by n (or alternatively, n **divides** m) if there exists [j 'BL' Z] such that [m = j * n. We use the notation [n | m]. 
3. Preservation and Omission
    1. Preservation and Omission depend on the comprehensibility of authors and readers.
    
    2. Detial steps are recommand for Apprentices.
### 4. Subtraction
1. The definition of substruction
   m - n is now defined to be m + (-m)
2. For all [m,n,p,q 'BL' Z]:
    1. (m - n) + (p - q) = (m + p) - (n + q)
    2. (m - n) - (p - q) = (m + q) - (n + p)
    3. [m - n = p - q] if and only if [m + q = n + p] 
    4. (m - n) * p = m * p - n * p.
